Move list_creatives and sync_creatives from media-buy to creative protocol. All creative library operations now live in one protocol — any agent hosting a creative library implements the creative protocol for both reads and writes. Extend build_creative with library retrieval mode (creative_id, macro_values, media_buy_id, package_id). Add creative agent interaction models (supports_generation, supports_transformation, has_creative_library) to get_adcp_capabilities. New creative-variable.json schema for DCO variable definitions. Redesign list_creatives as a library catalog: replace include_performance/performance_score with include_snapshot (lightweight delivery snapshot following get_media_buys pattern), rename has_performance_data filter to has_served, add errors to response. Rename sub-asset.json to item.json and sub_assets to items throughout — neutral naming that works for both native (flat components) and carousel (repeated groups) patterns.
