# Agent Playbook

This is the canonical, shared behavior file for this repository. Claude,
Codex, and any future agent wrapper should point here so the repo has one
source of truth.

## Documentation Framework

This project uses **Mintlify** for documentation:
- All docs in `docs/` directory as Markdown/MDX
- Use `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language examples (NOT Docusaurus `<Tabs>`)
- Run with: `mintlify dev`

## Critical Rules

### Organization Naming
- ✅ **AgenticAdvertising.org** - the member organization
- ✅ **AdCP** - the protocol specification
- ❌ Never "Alliance for Agentic Advertising", "AAO", or "ADCP"

### Examples: No Real Brands or Agencies
- ❌ Never use real company names (brands, agencies, holding companies) in new examples
- ✅ Use fictional names: Acme Corp, Pinnacle Media, Nova Brands, etc.
- The brand seed data in migrations may list real domains for discovery purposes
- Enum values that reference industry standards (e.g., `"groupm"` viewability standard) are protocol terms, not examples

### Schema Compliance
All documentation and examples MUST match JSON schemas in `static/schemas/source/`:
- Verify fields exist in schema before documenting
- Remove examples that don't match schema (don't mark as `test=false`)
- Test with: `npm test -- --file docs/path/to/file.mdx`

### Expert Review Scenarios
When running expert agents against documentation changes, test both:
- **Conceptual correctness** — Is the framing right? Are terms used consistently?
- **End-to-end buyer workflows** — Walk through actual buyer journeys (discovery → preview → serve → audit). Include generative-specific flows (brief → pre-flight preview → live campaign → post-flight replay) and edge cases (conversational formats, quality mismatches, multi-format pipelines).

Conceptual reviews miss workflow gaps. Workflow reviews miss framing errors. Run both.

### Discriminated Union Error Handling
Always check for errors before accessing success fields:
```javascript
const result = await agent.syncCreatives({...});
if (result.errors) {
  console.error('Failed:', result.errors);
} else {
  console.log(`Success: ${result.creatives.length} items`);
}
```

### Design System
All HTML files in `server/public/` MUST use CSS variables from `/server/public/design-system.css`:
```css
/* ✅ */ color: var(--color-brand);
/* ❌ */ color: #667eea;
```

### UI Text Casing
Use **sentence case** for all UI labels, headings, and section headers:
- ✅ "Brand identity", "Creative assets", "Contact information"
- ❌ "Brand Identity", "Creative Assets", "Contact Information"

## JSON Schema Guidelines

### Discriminated Unions
Use explicit discriminator fields with `"type"` before `"const"`:
```json
{
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "kind": { "type": "string", "const": "variant_a" },
        "field_a": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["kind", "field_a"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Include common fields (like `ext`) inside each variant, not at root level.

### Schema Locations
- Source schemas: `static/schemas/source/` (development, serves as `latest`)
- Released versions: `dist/schemas/{version}/` (e.g., `2.5.3`, `3.0.0-beta.3`)
- Local access: `http://localhost:3000/schemas/latest/` when running dev server

### Schema URLs in Documentation

When linking to schemas in docs, use the correct version alias:

**Released schemas** - Use the major version alias:
```markdown
[$schema](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v3/media-buy/create-media-buy-request.json)
```

**Unreleased schemas** (exist in `static/schemas/source/` but not in any `dist/schemas/{version}/`) - Use `/schemas/latest/`:
```markdown
<!-- Using latest because this schema is not yet released in any version.
     Update to correct version alias after the next release. -->
[$schema](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/latest/media-buy/sync-audiences-request.json)
```

**How to check if a schema is released:**
1. Check `dist/schemas/` for the highest version number under each major (e.g., `3.0.0-beta.3` for v3, `2.5.3` for v2)
2. If the schema exists in a released version, use that major version alias (v3, v2)
3. If only in `static/schemas/source/`, use `latest`

**Version aliases:**
- `/schemas/v3/` → latest 3.x release (currently 3.0.0-beta.3)
- `/schemas/v2/` → latest 2.x release (currently 2.5.3)
- `/schemas/v1/` → points to `latest` (for backward compatibility)
- `/schemas/latest/` → development version (`static/schemas/source/`)

**CI validation:** The `check-schema-links.yml` workflow validates schema URLs in PRs and will warn about unreleased schemas or suggest the correct version.

### Protocol vs Task Response Separation
Task responses contain ONLY domain data. Protocol concerns (message, context_id, task_id, status) are handled by transport layer.

## Versioning

### Changesets
**NEVER manually edit versions.** Use changesets:
```bash
# Create .changeset/your-feature.md
---
"adcontextprotocol": minor
---
Description of change.
```

Types: `patch` (fixes), `minor` (new features), `major` (breaking), `--empty` (no protocol impact)

**Use `--empty` (no package entry) for everything that isn't a protocol change:**
- Addie (any server-side AI behavior, tools, routing, bolt app)
- Website / admin UI / member pages
- Documentation updates (docs/, mintlify)
- Infrastructure, deployment, migrations
- Internal tooling and scripts

Only use `patch`/`minor`/`major` when the change affects the published AdCP protocol spec — schemas, task definitions, API reference.

### Semantic Versioning for Schemas
- **PATCH**: Fix typos, clarify descriptions
- **MINOR**: Add optional fields, new enum values, new tasks
- **MAJOR**: Remove/rename fields, change types, remove enum values

### Addie Code Version
When making significant changes to Addie's core logic, bump `CODE_VERSION` in `server/src/addie/config-version.ts`.

**When to bump:**
- Claude client behavior (`claude-client.ts`)
- Tool implementations (`mcp/*.ts`)
- Message processing logic (`thread-service.ts`, `bolt-app.ts`)
- Router logic beyond `ROUTING_RULES` (`router.ts`)

**Format:** `YYYY.MM.N` (e.g., `2025.01.1`, `2025.01.2`, `2025.02.1`)

This creates a new Addie config version, allowing performance comparison before/after code changes.

## Deployment

Production deploys to **Fly.io** (not Vercel). Migrations run automatically on startup.
- Deploy logs: `fly logs -a <app-name>`
- SSH access: `fly ssh console -a <app-name>`

## Local Development

**Always use Docker for local testing:**
```bash
docker compose up --build  # Start postgres + app with auto-migrations
docker compose down -v     # Reset database
```

The app runs on `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` (from `.env.local`), defaulting to 3000. Static files in `server/public/` are hot-reloaded via volume mount.

### Environment Variables
- `CONDUCTOR_PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `DEV_USER_EMAIL` / `DEV_USER_ID` - Enable dev mode (local only)

### Slack Apps
Two separate apps with independent credentials:
1. **AgenticAdvertising.org Bot**: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
   - Events: `/api/slack/aaobot/events`
   - Commands: `/api/slack/aaobot/commands`
2. **Addie AI**: `ADDIE_BOT_TOKEN`, `ADDIE_SIGNING_SECRET` → `/api/slack/addie/events`

### Dev Login
With dev mode enabled, visit `/dev-login.html` to switch between admin/member/visitor test users.

## Documentation Locations

**Update for releases:**
- `docs/intro.mdx` - Info banner
- `server/public/index.html` - Homepage version
- `docs/reference/release-notes.mdx` - Release notes
- `docs/reference/roadmap.mdx` - Roadmap

**Auto-generated (don't edit):**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Managed by changesets

## Testable Documentation

Mark pages with `testable: true` in frontmatter. All code blocks will be executed:
```markdown
---
title: get_products
testable: true
---
```

JSON examples with `$schema` field are validated against schemas in CI.

## Format Conventions

### Field Naming
- `formats` = Array of full format objects
- `format_ids` = Array of format ID references

### Format ID Structure
Always structured objects:
```json
{
  "agent_url": "https://creatives.adcontextprotocol.org",
  "id": "display_300x250"
}
```

### Renders Structure
Visual formats use `renders` array with structured dimensions:
```json
{
  "renders": [{
    "role": "primary",
    "dimensions": { "width": 300, "height": 250, "unit": "px" }
  }]
}
```

## Quick Reference

### Useful Commands
```bash
docker compose up --build  # Local dev server (preferred)
npm run build              # Build TypeScript
npm test                   # Run tests
npm run lint               # Lint
npm run typecheck          # Type check
mintlify dev               # Docs dev server (requires mintlify CLI)
```

### Protocol Design Principles
1. MCP-Based
2. Asynchronous operations
3. Human-in-the-loop optional
4. Platform agnostic
5. AI-optimized

### Task Reference
- ✅ `get_products`, `create_media_buy`, `list_creative_formats`
- ❌ `discover_products`, `get_avails` (don't exist)

## Certification Program

AgenticAdvertising.org runs a three-tier certification program (Basics → Practitioner → Specialist) taught by Addie through interactive chat. Key files:

- **Curriculum**: `server/src/addie/mcp/certification-tools.ts` (teaching tools, module resources, scoring)
- **Teaching methodology**: `TEACHING_METHODOLOGY`, `BUILD_PROJECT_METHODOLOGY`, `CAPSTONE_METHODOLOGY` constants in certification-tools.ts
- **Framework doc**: `docs/learning/instructional-design.mdx` (authoritative source for teaching methodology)
- **Policies**: `docs/learning/policies/` (nondiscrimination, learner records, complaints, conflict of interest, IP, personnel)
- **Database**: `server/src/db/certification-db.ts` (progress, credentials, tracks)
- **API routes**: `server/src/routes/certification.ts` (public/authenticated endpoints)
- **UI**: `server/public/certification.html` (dashboard, LinkedIn sharing, credential display)

### Certification impact checklist

When making protocol changes (new tasks, schema changes, renamed fields, removed features):

1. **Check affected modules** — Which certification modules teach the changed concepts? Update `MODULE_RESOURCES` links and teaching context in `certification-tools.ts` if needed.
2. **Consider continuing education** — Breaking changes (`major` version bumps) that alter core concepts may require notifying credential holders. Credentials reference the protocol version at time of issuance.
3. **Update learning resources** — If you add or move documentation pages referenced in `MODULE_RESOURCES`, update the URLs.

When updating teaching methodology:

4. **Keep framework aligned** — When updating `TEACHING_METHODOLOGY`, `BUILD_PROJECT_METHODOLOGY`, or `CAPSTONE_METHODOLOGY` constants in `certification-tools.ts`, verify alignment with `docs/learning/instructional-design.mdx` and update both.
5. **Update policies if needed** — Changes to assessment, data handling, or personnel processes may require updates to the corresponding policy page in `docs/learning/policies/`.

When building new features (member profiles, dashboards, community pages):

6. **Surface credentials** — If the feature displays user identity or professional context, consider showing earned credentials.
7. **Link to certification** — New capability areas may warrant new modules or tracks. Note this in the changeset description so it can be planned.

### Security

Module and exam completion is only available through Addie's tool calls — never through REST API. This prevents users from self-reporting scores without actual assessment.

## Character Bible

**`specs/character-bible.md`** is the authoritative source for all recurring characters across documentation, certification, test fixtures, illustrations, and the homepage. Read it before writing narrative content or generating images.

### When to use the character bible

- **Writing walkthrough or overview pages** — Use the correct character for that domain. Don't invent new characters or rename existing ones.
- **Generating illustrations** — Copy the exact visual description from the bible into every Gemini prompt where that character appears. Character consistency across panels requires the full description in every prompt (Gemini has no cross-call memory).
- **Writing certification content** — Each certification path has a primary character and scenario. Use them.
- **Creating test fixtures** — Test scenarios map to specific characters and companies. Use canonical names.
- **Building homepage or marketing content** — The full cast (including Dayo and Addie) represents the breadth of the org's audience. Reference the bible for tone and framing.

### Character quick reference

| Character | Domain | Company | Role |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|
| Alex Reeves | Intro / overview | Pinnacle Agency | VP media ops |
| Sam Adeyemi | Media buy, signals (buy-side) | Pinnacle Agency | Senior media buyer |
| Jordan Ochoa | Governance | Pinnacle Agency | Campaign ops manager |
| Maya Johal | Creative | Pinnacle Agency | Creative strategist |
| Priya Nair | Seller integration | StreamHaus | Dir. ad products |
| Kai Lindgren | Signals (data provider side) | Meridian Geo | Head of partnerships |
| Tomoko Hara | Brand protocol + accounts | Nova Motors | Global brand ops manager |
| Dayo Mensah | Certification / learning | Pinnacle (fellow) | Ad tech fellow |
| Daniel Park | Commerce media | ShopGrid | VP retail media |
| Addie | All (connective tissue) | AgenticAdvertising.org | AI agent |

### Rules

- **Don't invent characters.** If a walkthrough needs a person, use someone from the bible. If no one fits, propose adding to the bible first.
- **Don't change visual descriptions.** The bible defines exactly what each character looks like. Copy it verbatim into image prompts.
- **First names only in docs.** Use "Sam" not "Sam Adeyemi" in walkthrough prose. Full names are for the bible and metadata.
- **Addie is a participant, not a tool.** In any context where Addie appears alongside humans, she's at the table — not behind the desk, not in the background.
- **Dayo uses they/them pronouns.**
- **Companies are fictional.** Pinnacle Agency, StreamHaus, Meridian Geo, Nova Motors, etc. Never substitute real company names.

## Illustrated Documentation

### Gemini image generation

**Model**: `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` (via `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]`)

**Base style prompt** (include in every image request):
```
Flat illustration, teal/emerald color palette (#047857 primary, #0d9488 secondary, #134e4a dark accents).
Graphic novel style with clean panel borders. Clean, minimal linework with subtle gradients.
Tech-forward but warm. No real brand names or logos.
Wide aspect ratio suitable for documentation headers (roughly 16:9).
Characters should have simple but expressive faces. Use white/light backgrounds for readability.
```

**Character prompts**: Copy the full visual description from `specs/character-bible.md` into every panel prompt where that character appears. Include hair, skin tone, clothing, and distinguishing features. Gemini cannot share state across API calls — if you skip the description in one panel, the character will look different.

**Generation script**: `scripts/generate-images.ts` — accepts a JSON prompt file and generates images via Gemini API. Run with `npx tsx scripts/generate-images.ts <prompt-file.json>`.

**Prompt files**: `scripts/prompts-*.json` — one per walkthrough. Each entry has `filename`, `prompt`, and `alt_text`. The script validates generated images for gibberish text and alt text accuracy.

**Image locations**:
- `images/walkthrough/` — narrative panels for walkthrough pages
- `images/concepts/` — educational diagrams for concept explanations and curriculum

Mintlify serves from `/images/...`.

**Pages with illustrated walkthrough treatment**:
- `docs/intro.mdx` — Alex's fragmentation story (5 panels)
- `docs/media-buy/index.mdx` — Sam's media buy journey (7 panels)
- `docs/governance/overview.mdx` — Jordan's governance setup (7 panels)
- `docs/creative/index.mdx` — Maya's creative campaign workflow (7 panels)
- `docs/signals/overview.mdx` — Sam + Kai's signals ecosystem (6 panels)
- `docs/governance/embedded-human-judgment.mdx` — EHJ manifesto (references governance concept diagrams)
- `docs/protocol/architecture.mdx` — Protocol architecture (2 concept diagrams)

### Documentation nav structure

Walkthrough pages use progressive disclosure — grouped by reader intent:
1. **Top level**: Overview + visual walkthrough (front door for everyone)
2. **Concepts**: Strategic/conceptual content with concept diagrams
3. **Implementation**: Integration guides for builders
4. **Reference**: Task reference and specification pages

Apply this pattern when restructuring protocol sections.

## Cross-Agent Integration

- **Role definitions** live in `.agents/roles/*.md` (markdown with frontmatter).
  These are the canonical source for all subagent/role prompts.
- **Prompt shortcuts** live in `.agents/shortcuts/`.
- **Codex wiring** (`.codex/`) is generated from `.agents/roles/` via
  `node scripts/import-claude-agents.mjs`. Don't edit `.codex/agents/` by hand.
- **Claude Code** can read `.agents/roles/` directly as project-scoped agents.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are thin compatibility wrappers only.
- Add or change shared repo behavior here first, then update wrappers only if
  the agent needs a pointer to the new location.
