Operators of websites or online services directed to children, or that have actual knowledge they are collecting information from children under 13, must post a clear privacy policy, provide notice to parents, and obtain verifiable parental consent before collection.

Purpose limitation: Personal data collected for one purpose cannot be repurposed for advertising without additional consent. Data minimization: Only data strictly necessary for the stated advertising purpose may be processed.

Age of digital consent varies by member state (13-16 years). For users below the applicable age, parental consent is required. Data Protection Impact Assessments may be required for large-scale profiling for advertising purposes.

No health or medical claims unless specifically permitted by state regulation.

Digital considerations: For space-constrained formats (banner ads, social posts), a clear and prominent link to full prescribing information must be provided. Scrollable or expandable ad units should present risk information with the same prominence as benefit claims.

 'The Scope3 Common Sense brand safety framework establishes a baseline for content adjacency in digital advertising. It defines categories of content where advertising placement poses unacceptable risk to brand reputation, and distinguishes between content that should never carry ads and content requiring brand-by-brand judgment.

Content that must be excluded from all advertising: illegal content (CSAM, trafficking, illegal drug sales), terrorist and violent extremist propaganda, content promoting self-harm or suicide, and deliberately deceptive health misinformation designed to cause physical harm.

Content requiring graduated assessment: political opinion and social commentary, coverage of conflict and violence in journalism, mature themes in entertainment, and user-generated content on mixed-quality platforms. For these categories, context matters — a news article reporting on terrorism is fundamentally different from terrorist propaganda. Legitimate journalism, educational content, and documentary coverage should not be automatically excluded.

This framework is a floor, not a ceiling. Brands MAY layer additional restrictions based on their values, risk tolerance, and category-specific concerns. The exemplars below calibrate the boundary between common-sense exclusion and context-dependent judgment.',

 'Political advertising is subject to transparency and disclosure requirements that vary by jurisdiction but share common principles. These requirements apply to candidate advertising, issue advocacy, ballot measures, and government communications.

EU Digital Services Act (DSA): Very large online platforms must label political ads with clear identification that the content is advertising. Platforms must provide transparency about who paid for the ad and why a specific user was targeted. Political ad repositories must be maintained and made publicly accessible. These provisions apply to platforms with 45 million or more EU users.

US requirements: Federal law requires "paid for by" disclosures identifying the sponsor of political advertising. A growing number of states require additional disclosure when political ads use AI-generated or AI-manipulated content (California, Texas, Washington, and others). The FEC requires disclaimers on digital political ads that meet certain size and spending thresholds.

General principles: political advertising must clearly identify the funding source. Micro-targeting criteria should be available to users upon request. AI-generated or manipulated content in political ads must be disclosed with clear labeling. During election periods, heightened scrutiny applies, and some jurisdictions impose blackout periods before elections.',
 '{"pass": [{"scenario": "A political action committee runs digital display ads with clear ''Paid for by Citizens for Clean Energy PAC'' disclosure, AI-generated imagery labeled as such, and the ad is registered in the platform''s political ad library.", "explanation": "The ad includes sponsor identification, AI content disclosure, and platform transparency requirements. Compliant across US federal and EU DSA requirements."}, {"scenario": "A government agency runs informational ads about a new public health program with clear ''Official government communication'' labeling and no micro-targeting beyond geographic relevance.", "explanation": "Government communications identified as such, with geographic (not behavioral) targeting, meet transparency requirements."}], "fail": [{"scenario": "A dark money group runs issue ads about immigration policy with no sponsor identification, using AI-generated deepfake imagery of a public official, with no AI disclosure.", "explanation": "Missing sponsor identification violates federal ''paid for by'' requirements. AI-generated deepfake of a public official without disclosure violates state-level AI transparency laws. The ad is non-compliant on multiple grounds."}, {"scenario": "A political campaign runs micro-targeted ads on a major EU platform with no entry in the platform''s ad library and no information about why specific users were targeted.", "explanation": "Missing political ad library entry and targeting transparency violate EU DSA requirements for very large platforms."}]}'::jsonb,

 'Advertising directed at or likely to be seen by children requires additional protections beyond standard advertising practices. These standards complement the US-specific us_coppa regulation with broader international consensus on protecting children in advertising.

Age-appropriate advertising: Ads directed at children must not exploit their credulity, lack of experience, or sense of loyalty. No high-pressure sales tactics, no urgency language (''buy now or miss out''), and no blurring of advertising and editorial content. Children should be able to distinguish advertising from entertainment or educational content.

UK CAP/BCAP Code: Specific rules for audiences under 16 include restrictions on food and drink advertising to children (see uk_hfss for HFSS-specific rules), prohibition on direct exhortations to buy (''ask your parents to buy...''), and no suggesting that children will be inferior or unpopular for not purchasing a product. Ads must not condone or encourage unsafe behavior.

EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD): Member states must ensure advertising does not cause moral or physical detriment to minors. Product placement is restricted in children''s programming. Sponsorship of children''s programs must not directly encourage purchase of products or services.

Digital-specific protections: No behavioral targeting of children below jurisdiction-specific age thresholds (13 in the US under COPPA, 16 in some EU member states under GDPR). Data collection from children should be minimized. Age-gating mechanisms are required before serving age-restricted product advertising. This standard applies to ALL advertising likely to be seen by children, not just advertising explicitly targeted at them.',

Blurring advertising and entertainment content exploits children''s inability to distinguish ads from content."}, {"scenario": "A fashion brand runs ads on a youth-oriented social platform featuring language like ''Don''t be the only one without it — get yours before they''re gone!'' with no age-gating.", "explanation": "Direct exhortation with social pressure (''only one without it'') and urgency tactics (''before they''re gone'') violate children''s advertising standards. No age-gating on a youth platform compounds the violation."}]}'::jsonb,
