-- Migration: Integrate campaign governance across certification curriculum
--
-- Campaign governance provides always-on compliance for autonomous agent
-- transactions. Media plans already exist in the industry — campaign governance
-- ties campaigns to those plans and protects them so a malicious, hallucinating,
-- or otherwise out-of-line agent can't violate what the buyer decided.
--
-- This migration updates teaching guidance across all tiers:
--   A1: Trust narrative (always-on compliance, three-party validation)
--   A3: Campaign governance in the domain survey
--   B3: Seller-side governance checks and planned delivery
--   C2: Campaign plans, governance loop, policy registry
--   D2: Platform implementation of governance flow
--   S4: Expanded governance capstone with campaign governance labs

Three independent parties check each action — the buyer''s orchestrator, an independent governance agent, and the seller. No single party grades its own homework. This isn''t a new concept — media plans already exist. Campaign governance just makes sure every campaign ties to that plan, automatically, on every transaction.
