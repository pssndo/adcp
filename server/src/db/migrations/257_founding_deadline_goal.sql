  E'Hi {{user_name}} \u2014 AgenticAdvertising.org is building open standards for AI-powered advertising, and the people shaping those standards are founding members. Founding member enrollment closes March 31, after which membership pricing increases.\n\nIf your team works in ad tech, media, or AI-powered advertising, this is the last window to join at the founding rate and have a voice in where the industry goes.\n\n{{link_url}}',
  E'{{user_name}} \u2014 one more thing I wanted to mention: founding members get access to working groups drafting standards like AdCP (the ad context protocol) and the AI transparency framework. Enrollment closes in {{days_remaining}} days. Let me know if I can help your team get set up.\n\n{{link_url}}',
  E'Founding members get a seat at the table shaping open standards for AI-powered advertising \u2014 things like ad context protocols, transparency frameworks, and measurement guidelines. They also get locked-in pricing that never increases, access to working groups and industry councils, and the community directory.\n\n{{link_url}}',
