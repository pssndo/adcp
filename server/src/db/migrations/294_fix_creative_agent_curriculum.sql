-- Migration 294: Fix curriculum content that treats "creative agent" as a
-- distinct entity type separate from sales agents. In reality, any agent
-- implementing the Creative Protocol is a creative agent — including sales
-- agents that declare both media_buy and creative in supported_protocols.

-- A2: Fix "Agent roles in action" to explain protocol composition
