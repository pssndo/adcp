I just joined AgenticAdvertising.org because I think the way agents buy and sell media needs a shared language that no single company controls.

If you've ever lost a week to integration debugging between platforms, this is worth a look.

We're about to repeat the same interoperability mess we've been fighting for the last decade -- unless there's a protocol layer underneath. That's what AdCP is building: an open standard so agents from different platforms can actually transact.

Just joined the organization building it.

AdCP is an open protocol that gives agents a common language for media buying. I joined the org building it. If you've done the same spec translation enough times, you'll get why.
